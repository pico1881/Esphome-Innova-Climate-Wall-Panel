# Esphome-Innova-Climate
The ``innova_climate`` climate platform creates a climate device which can be used
to control a Innova fancoil via modbus communication. 

![test_image](/images/innova_climate.jpg)

This component supports the following functionality:
- Set the operating mode: off, heat, cool
- Set the desired fan speed: auto, high (maximum), medium (silent), low (night)
- Set the desired target temperature

Optional you can set sensors:
- Current temperature
- Target temperature
- Water temperature
- Fan speed sensor
  
binary sensors:
- Output boiler relay status
- Output chiller relay status

and a switch:
- Keyboard lock switch for lock the on-board keyboard (same function when you push + and - key on the device)

Hardware setup
--------------
Tested with Innova INN-FR-B32 board, can work with same board installed on other brand fancoil, for more details read the PDF file.
--------------

You need an RS485 transceiver module:

a DC-DC step down regulator like this with the output voltage regulated at 5V from 12V input:

Connect all as this schematic, don't forget to apply jumper at RTU pin on the Innova board:

### Software

To use this component in your ESPHome configuration, follow the example below.
NOTE: verify the modbus address of fancoil board, default is 1, refer to the attached manual for advanced settings.
